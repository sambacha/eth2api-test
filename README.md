## Optic CI default API rules

Check your OpenAPI file today for breaking changes to your API. Optic CI comes with a set of default rules that checks for common breaking changes to your API such as:

- Making existing query parameters or request properties required.
- Changing query parameter or property types
- Adding required parameters or request properties
- Removing response properties

These checks work out of the box with our Optic API checks, and can be run via GitHub actions. The following example workflow definition will check the `openapi.yaml` file in the root of your project as it exists on your Pull Request against the target branch of the Pull Request. The differences will be run through the default rules and report any issues. The failures will be annotated in the action run and in your code changes, helping you find what went wrong, why it went wrong, and where to fix it:

**.github/workflows/optic-ci.yml**
```yaml
name: Optic CI example workflow definition

on: [ pull_request ]

jobs:
  optic-ci:
    name: Optic API Checks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Run Optic cli
        uses: opticdev/optic-ci-starter@main
        with:
          file: openapi.yaml
          ruleset: default
```
